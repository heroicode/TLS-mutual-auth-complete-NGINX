# TLS Client/Mutual-Auth with NGINX

Minimal project of client using mTLS (Mutual TLS authentication).
(Not entirely minimal since it uses JSONâ€¦)

The [configure](./configure.sh) script will generate all the necessary certificate/key pairs.
The [test](./test.sh) script will verify that the certificates are properly served and correctly verified by both client and server, and test for common errors.

The entire project can be exercised with a single command sequence:
```shell
just depends configure test clean
```

Each target can also be run individually, and the scripts can be executed directly if [just](https://just.systems/) is not installed:

```shell
./configure
./test.sh
rm ./conf/*.pem
```

It's possible to do configuration and testing entirely inside containers.
Example:
```shell
docker compose create nginx
docker compose run --rm nginx sh -c /configure.sh
docker compose up --detach
docker compose exec nginx sh -c 'NGINX_HTTPS=443 /test.sh'
docker compose run --rm nginx sh -c 'rm "$conf"/*.pem'
docker compose down
```
